# Claude Code Orchestrator

A workflow system for Claude Code that guides development through focused agent phases with human approval gates.

## Overview

This orchestrator runs inside Claude Code conversations, directing Claude through a structured workflow: Explorer â†’ Criteria Gate â†’ Planner â†’ Coder â†’ Verifier â†’ Completion Gate. At decision gates, the workflow pauses and presents slash command options for you to control the next steps.

The key insight is separating the work phases (automated) from the decision points (human-controlled), while maintaining context isolation between agents through `/clear` commands and file-based handoffs.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install Claude Orchestrator with a single command:

```bash
# Install in current directory (project-local slash command)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash

# Install in specific directory
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --project-dir ~/my-project

# Install with global slash command (available in all projects)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelo-alvarez/claude-orchestrator/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --project-dir ~/my-project --global
```

### Generate Initial Tasks

Use the bootstrap command to analyze your project and generate initial tasks:
```
/orchestrate bootstrap
```

Claude will:
1. Analyze your codebase and project structure
2. Ask about your goals and priorities
3. Generate specific, actionable tasks
4. Create both `tasks.md` and `tasks-checklist.md` files

Alternatively, manually add tasks to `.claude/tasks-checklist.md`:
```markdown
- [ ] Fix authentication bug
- [ ] Add user profile feature
```

### Usage
Start a workflow in Claude Code:
```
/orchestrate start
```

Claude will work through the Explorer phase automatically, then pause at the Criteria Gate:
```
ðŸšª CRITERIA GATE: Human Review Required
â€¢ /orchestrate approve-criteria
â€¢ /orchestrate modify-criteria "your changes"  
â€¢ /orchestrate retry-explorer
```

Choose your path and the workflow continues based on your decision.

## Workflow

```
Explorer â”€â”€â†’ Criteria Gate â”€â”€â†’ Planner â”€â”€â†’ Coder â”€â”€â†’ Verifier â”€â”€â†’ Completion Gate
   â†“              â†“               â†“          â†“          â†“              â†“
analyzes     USER APPROVES     creates   implements  verifies     USER APPROVES
  task         criteria         plan      changes     results      completion
```

**Automated phases:** Explorer, Planner, Coder, Verifier run automatically and hand off to the next phase.

**Decision gates:** Criteria Gate and Completion Gate pause for human input via slash commands.

**Context isolation:** Each agent starts with `/clear` and communicates through files in `.agent-outputs/`.

## Commands

**Workflow control:**
- `/orchestrate bootstrap` - Generate initial tasks for your project
- `/orchestrate start` - Start fresh workflow  
- `/orchestrate continue` - Continue to next agent
- `/orchestrate status` - Show current progress
- `/orchestrate clean` - Reset outputs

**Gate decisions:**
- `/orchestrate approve-criteria` - Accept criteria and continue
- `/orchestrate modify-criteria "changes"` - Edit criteria based on feedback
- `/orchestrate approve-completion` - Mark task complete
- `/orchestrate retry-from-planner` - Restart from planning phase

## Architecture

The orchestrator is a state machine where:
- Python script (`.claude/orchestrate.py`) manages workflow state and generates agent instructions
- Claude Code executes the instructions within the conversation
- Files in `.agent-outputs/` provide context between isolated agent phases
- Human input via slash commands controls workflow branching at decision points

## File Structure

```
.claude/                 # Orchestrator files
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ orchestrate.md   # Slash command (if local install)
â”œâ”€â”€ orchestrate.py       # Workflow engine
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.md            # Task status tracking
â””â”€â”€ tasks-checklist.md  # Task list (source of truth)

â”œâ”€â”€ explorer/CLAUDE.md
â”œâ”€â”€ planner/CLAUDE.md
â”œâ”€â”€ coder/CLAUDE.md
â””â”€â”€ verifier/CLAUDE.md

.agent-outputs/          # Agent work products
â”œâ”€â”€ exploration.md       # Task analysis and suggested criteria
â”œâ”€â”€ success-criteria.md  # Approved success criteria  
â”œâ”€â”€ plan.md             # Implementation plan
â”œâ”€â”€ changes.md          # Code changes made
â””â”€â”€ verification.md     # Verification results
```

## Design Principles

**Separation of concerns:** Python manages workflow state, Claude does the development work, human makes decisions.

**Context isolation:** Each agent gets fresh context to avoid pollution and maintain focus.

**File-based communication:** Agents pass information through structured files rather than conversation history.

**Human control:** Decision gates prevent runaway automation and ensure human oversight of critical choices.

## Custom Agent Creation

The orchestrator supports custom agent types beyond the built-in ones (explorer, planner, coder, verifier). You can create specialized agents for your specific workflows.

### Creating a Custom Agent

1. **Create the agent directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p templates/agents/my-custom-agent
   ```

2. **Create the agent template file:**
   ```bash
   # templates/agents/my-custom-agent/CLAUDE.md
   ```

3. **Define the agent template:**
   ```markdown
   You are the MY-CUSTOM-AGENT agent.

   TASK: {{task}}

   YOUR ONLY RESPONSIBILITIES:
   1. Perform specialized analysis
   2. Generate custom reports
   3. Write findings to .agent-outputs/custom-analysis.md

   FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
   - Modifying source code
   - Making implementation decisions
   - Creating unrelated files

   When complete, output: MY-CUSTOM-AGENT COMPLETE

   Then execute: /clear

   Then execute: /orchestrate continue
   ```

### Template Format Requirements

**Required Elements:**
- **Work section:** Description of agent responsibilities and tasks
- **Completion phrase:** Must be in format "AGENT-NAME COMPLETE"
- **Variables:** Use `{{variable}}` format for substitution (e.g., `{{task}}`)

**Best Practices:**
- Define clear responsibilities section
- Specify forbidden actions to maintain focus
- Use uppercase completion phrases
- Include /clear and /orchestrate continue commands

### Variable Substitution

Custom agents support variable substitution:
- `{{task}}` - The current task being worked on
- `{{custom_var}}` - Any custom variables you define

Variables are automatically detected and can be passed when creating agent instances.

### Integration with Workflows

Custom agents are automatically discovered and can be:
- Listed in available agents (`orchestrator.agent_factory.get_available_agents()`)
- Integrated into workflow sequences
- Used in orchestration commands

The system validates custom templates to ensure they have required fields and proper structure.
